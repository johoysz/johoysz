# 👋 Hello there, I'm @johoysz

🎓 Just graduated, currently in that exciting (and terrifying) phase of figuring it all out.

## 🚀 About Me
- 💡 I’m passionate about **coding**, **design**, and a bit of **creative editing**.
- 🔍 Always exploring new tools.
- ⚡ Slightly scared of being a *jack of all trades, master of none*, but hey, **doing it scared is still doing it** 😄

## 📌 Interests
- 💻 Full Stack Development
- 🎨 UI/UX Design & Prototyping
- 🛠️ Web Apps & Side Projects
- 🖼️ Photo/Video Editing (because aesthetics matter!)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Here are a few tools and languages I’ve worked with:
- Languages: `JavaScript`, `Python`, `Java`, `PHP`
- Web: `HTML/CSS`, `Laravel`, `React`, `ASP.NET`
- Design: `Figma`, `Photoshop`, `Lightroom`, `Canva`
- Others: `Git`, `MySQL`, `CloudPano`, `Inertia.js`, `HuggingFace`, `FlowiseAI`, `Heroku`, `Docker`
